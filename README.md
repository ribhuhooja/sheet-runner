# sheet-runner

My DALI lab unity project submission, for the AR/VR challenge.

This is unfortunately still a work in progress, and not all
functionality from the idea is in the repo currently.

The IDEA - 
A melody is played, and the player has to recreate that melody by moving
the player character to the right spot on the staff line at the right time.

Implementation - 
In the current implementation, there is no "game" yet, but the player can move the
character to the right spot to play whatever melody is desired.

Controls:
W and S or arrow keys to move up or down
Space to toggle note-playing mode
Hold shift to temporarily go out of bounds (upto a limit)

## Build
The built project can be viewed here:

## Other Notes
The "notes" audio files are taken from https://theremin.music.uiowa.edu/MISpiano.html

Since this project is still incomplete, I think a much more complete demonstration of my unity
skills is the Sapsling project, which I submitted as a code sample.
